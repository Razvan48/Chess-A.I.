# Chess-A.I. | _C++, MinMax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning, position hashing, move ordering_

&emsp; The program is able to play Chess at an ELO rating of 1300 points. <br/>
&emsp; It is based on a brute-force search with a few optimisations applied (Alpha-Beta Pruning, position hashing, move ordering and others). <br/>
&emsp; It uses bitboards for faster moves generation. <br/>
&emsp; A lot of logical operations and instructions were used. <br/>
